# Explainable-ReliableSkinLesionMultiClassification
Utilising Deep Learning Architecture to develop strong reliable and understandable models. Utilising over 10,000 different images and investigating multi-classification. 

Different deep learning architectures from traditional/modern CNNs (ResNet/EffNet) to Visual Tranformers to Contrast Learning Model incorporating Modern CNNs as backbone.
